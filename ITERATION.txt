The feedback of my P1 Spike focused on my control and some of the instructions. For example, the player was initially confused with how to grab food (you have to hold on to a button to do so). In my P2 Gold, I make use of the XBox Controllers to improve the experience. Also I made the game into a multiplayer form so that two users can compete against each other. I think this makes the game more fun as the weird physics can seem to be rediculous but entertaining with two players. I also improved on the instructions. For example, in my P1 Spike, users reflected that it is hard to locate the chopstick, especially when it does not cast shadow on the broth. I made a shadow object to follow along the chopsticks so it is easier to figure out the location. Also I added halo to the food object to let my users know then they're able to grab them. In the previous version, users mentioned that the text reminder is hard to read and is confusing. Color codings and score text are also added to let the users know what state the food in currently in and when they score.
